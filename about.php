		<h1>About me</h1>
		<p>
			I am Jennifer Welch Hayes, and I am 2011 Graduate of William Carey University with a Bachelor of Music in Vocal Performance.
			I have taught piano and voice since 2009. As a teacher, I love to see students grasp new concepts and learn new skills. I also
			love to help students incorporate their own unique personalities into the music they sing and play. E-mail or call today if you are
			interested in lessons. I teach adults as well. It's never to late to learn!
